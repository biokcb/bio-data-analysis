# Lazy uTrack
This project consists of MATLAB helper scripts to be used alongside the uTrack software. This was part of a rotation project I did in 2013 for a biomedical/neuroscience lab that studied ion channel trafficking in neurons. I collected TIRF imaging data and optimized the uTrack parameters to fix artifacts and make the data more biologically sound. I wrote a document that explained the basics of how uTrack works and how biologists can use the software and optimize parameters based on my tests of the software. I created helper scripts for the lab members to use to automate their image processing and modify to help non-engineers in the lab analyze their own data.
