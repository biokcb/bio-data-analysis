# Scripts for biological data analysis
Scripts I've written for analyzing various types of data that were not large enough projects to warrant their own repository. Mainly for analyzing and plotting next generation sequencing data, but other random scripts may get tossed in here from time to time. Many of these may be dataset and project specific - sometimes the specific analysis is done first then generalized. 

# Folders
This is organized into folders based on broader categories for the type of data analysis or if it was a short, individual project. Here is the basic breakdown:


- lab_assays: Data analysis scripts for various wet lab experiments I did
- next_gen_sequencing: Data analysis scripts & short projects for various NGS data sets, usually mRNA-seq and smRNA-seq. Some for taking raw sequencing data to counts tables and further exploratory analysis and plotting.
- microarray: Data analysis of microarray datasets
- imaging: Imaging data analysis
- misc: everything else
