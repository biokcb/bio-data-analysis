# Scripts for biological data analysis
Scripts I've written that were not large enough projects to warrant their own repository. Many of these are dataset and project specific. This is an *incomplete history* of scripts written and used over the years and will be updated as I find old scripts or create new ones. If you look through them, it sort of represents my progress in learning to write better code, so there's a range of skill level represented here, especially as a self-taught programmer from a more scientific background. Sometimes I go back and update the scripts as well, especially if I start needing to repeat analyses. 


**Note**: Anything with a date in the name is a specific analysis that is more of a history of commands used to perform that analysis and is less likely to be reused. 


# Folders
This is organized into folders based on broader categories for the type of data analysis or if it was a short, individual project. Here is the basic breakdown:


- lab_assays: Data analysis scripts for various wet lab experiments I did
- next_gen_sequencing: Data analysis scripts & short projects for various NGS data sets, usually mRNA-seq and smRNA-seq. Some for taking raw sequencing data to counts tables and further exploratory analysis and plotting.
- microarray: Data analysis of microarray datasets
- imaging: Imaging data analysis
- misc: everything else
